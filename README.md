# JS-Quiz-v1

This application is designed to quiz the user, a beginner Javascript user, on various basic Javascript topics. 
The score of the user will be calculated based on remaining time and recorded. 
The user can then save their score with their initials so that their scores can be compared with others'.


Because this is just the first version of this app, the question selection is quite sparce. 
However, the quiz should be fully operational. 

Upon initiliazing, the application will show a screen like this: 


When the start button is pressed, questions will appear in the center of the viewport, while the time remaining will be shown in the top right corner. 

Correct answers will show a new question. However, incorrect answers will subtract ten seconds from time. 

Upon answering all questions correctly, or failing the quiz by running out of time, the score (remaining time) will be displayed and the user will be prompted to enter their initials.

When the user submits their initials, they will be taken to a scoreboard that shows all recorded scores.
